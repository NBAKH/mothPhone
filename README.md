# MOTHxPHONE

In June '15 I created a phone for moths in collaboration with artist/activist/engineer, Natalie Jeremijenko, for her project MOTxCINEMA.
It was made using MAX MSP to identify the frequency of the voice of the speaker using the phone and the nocturne playing in a spectrum audible for the human ear. That frequency was send to a micro controller and pitched to the ultrasonic spectrum which is audible to moth, but not humans. In that way the nocturne became a cross species concert and the audience got the possibility to speak to the moths.

This repository aims to make a new and better version of the above mentioned phone and a version that is easy to replicate for others.
As of now I'm trying to explore the possibilities of the Raspberry Pi and audio processing in Python.
This will contain the code as i go along but also links to website and notes to create an open process and document it as i go.
